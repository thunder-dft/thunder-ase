# Thunder ASE

### Description
The interface of ASE for FIREBALL.

[FIREBALL](https://fireball-dft.org) is an open source and high efficiency DFT software based on local-orbital ab-initio method, allows for the simulation very large supercells of thousands of atoms. [ASE](https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase/index.html) is a popular python package for atomic structure modeling. ASE provide interfaces with many QM and MM software. This `thunder-ase` package is not only the ASE interface for FIREBALL, but also provides many other useful functions.

### Installation

`pip install -U thunder-ase`

#### Requirements

* ase (version <= 3.22.1, there is a bug for later version.)
* spglib
* dftd4 and dftd4-python for DFT-D4 (optional)

### Tutorial

#### Simple example

```Python
from thunder_ase.fireball import Fireball
from ase.build import molecule

atoms = molecule('C6H6')
Fdata_path = 'YOUR_FDATA_PATH'

kwargs = {'iwriteout_charges': 1,  # Writing out the charges.
          'efermi_T': 200.0,
          'ipi': 1, # use i-PI socket protocol. Default is 0. Recommended for optimization and MD.
          }

calc = Fireball(command='YOUR_PATH for fireball-ase.x', 
                Fdata_path=Fdata_path,
                **kwargs)
atoms.calc = calc

e0 = atoms.get_potential_energy()
efermi = atoms.calc.get_fermi_level()

print("The energy is {:.3f} eV.".format(e0))
print("The Fermi Level is {:.3f} eV.".format(efermi))

# Optimization the Structure
calc.minimize(atoms, fmax=0.1, method='MDMin')

print("The energy for optimized structure is {:.3f} eV.".format(atoms.get_potential_energy()))
```

### Basic Parameters

* `qstate` : The charge state of the system. Default is 0. Positive values mean add extra electrons, negatives mean remove electrons.
* `efermi_t`: Smearing temperature at Fermi level. Default is 100.0, which is about 0.0086 eV. For metal system, larger value is recommended.
* `max_scf_iterations_set`: Scf steps maximum. Default is 50.
* `scf_tolerance_set`: Scf tolerance of charge. Default is 1.0E-6. Smaller value is recommended for higher precision, e.g. 1.0E-8.
* `beta_set`: Broyden’s mix factor of charges. Default is 0.08.
* `ecut_set`: To control mesh grid density. Default is 200.0.
* `iwriteout_charges`: Write out charges. Default is  0 (False).

**The following keywords only for Thunder-ASE**

* `kpt_size`: Size of k point sampling. Default is None for molecules and [1, 1, 1] for crystals.
* `kpt_offset`: Offset for k point sampling. Default is None for molecules and [0., 0., 0.] for crystals.
* `kpt_interval`: Define kpoint sampling by the interval. Default is None.
* `kpt_path`: K points path to obtain band structure. Default is None. See more in [`ase.dft.kpoints.BandPath`](https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase/ase/dft/kpoints.html#band-path).
* `nkpt`: Number of kpoints on path. Default is None. Used if `kpt_path` is defined by string.
* `kpt_reduced`: Whether reduce the k points. Default is True.
* `kpt_gamma`: . Gamma centre mesh. Default is True.

#### Advanced Parameters

* `iconstraint_rcm`: Whether shifts molecule to center of mass (COM) before the simulation. Default is 1 (True).
* `ifix_neighbors`: Fix the neighbor list of the system to initial structure. Default is  0 (False).
* `ifix_charges`: Fix the charges of the system to initial structure. Default is  0 (False). This is useful sometimes for very unreasonable initial structures.
* `iwriteout_me_sandh`: Write out overlap (S) and Hamiltonian (H) matrix. Default is 0 (False).
* `iwriteout_cdcoeffs`: Write out orbital coefficients. Default is 0 (False).
* `iwriteout_density`: Write out density matrix. Default is  0 (False).
* `iwriteout_energies`: Write out all energy terms. Default is  0 (False).
* `iwriteout_populations`: Measure the localization by the entropic quantity W. Default is  0 (False). W is the number of accessible atoms for the given electronic energy and which describes the spatial extent of the electronic state. See more in Refs. H. Wang and J. P. Lewis, J. Phys.: Condens. Matter 18, 421–434 (2005) and  H. Wang and J. P. Lewis, J. Phys.: Condens. Matter 17, L209–L213 (2005).
